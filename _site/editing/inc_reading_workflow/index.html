    <h2>current workflow 2024-01-04</h2>
<p>before incremental reading, i set a learning process and an outcome goal.
starting with the outcome goal is a good idea, because setting an intention changes the way you read.
setting a learning process should be in service of the goal.
most importantly: there's no one size fits all.
staying flexible and undogmatic is the only way to go.
if there's a better approach, adapt it immediately.
for example, sometimes it's important that your incremental reading sticks to the literature, especially when creating flashcards is an outcome goal.
however, sometimes it's good to ponder and tinker around a bit.
there's usually three outcome goals i'm aiming for:</p>
<ul>
<li>creating flashcards üß†</li>
<li>creating an evergreen note üå±</li>
<li>creating actionables ‚ö°Ô∏è</li>
</ul>
<p>keep your incremental reading as distraction-free as possible; internally and externally.
for me, thinking if this is a good question or note is very distracting.
therefore, i just write, write, write, i can edit or remove the questions later.
it's okay if your notes are messy, just focus on output in this phase.</p>
<p>i then usually have a scratchpad besides me.
nothing can replace pen and paper.
write down questions and answers in &quot;Q:&quot;, &quot;A:&quot; pairs.
write down remarks with &quot;R:&quot;, notes with &quot;N:&quot;.
while writing down, ask yourself three questions: &quot;why does this work?&quot;, &quot;what are the implications of this?&quot; and &quot;can i view this concept from a different lens?&quot;.
these three questions will be the motor of your thinking.
once you start writing, don't stop until you feel like you answered the questions.
never prefilter.
asking why over and over again is a powerful method to get to the quintessence of something.
when done with the first iteration of incremental reading: transfer the notes to obsidian</p>
<p>while transfering, i do basic editing.
mostly just rephrasing a little, like giving new sentence starters for the question prompt:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;define&quot;
<ul>
<li>formal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;conceptualize&quot;
<ul>
<li>informal</li>
<li>verb flashcards</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;describe&quot;
<ul>
<li>verb flashcardsa</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;analogize&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;why&quot;/&quot;intuit&quot;
<ul>
<li>adjective-like flashcards</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;summarize&quot;
<ul>
<li>one sentence that nails it</li>
<li>can be almost aphorisms</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;what&quot;/&quot;which&quot;
<ul>
<li>noun flashcards</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;when&quot;
<ul>
<li>r: not sure if to keep this, maybe having less starting words and less concepts is a better way of thinking
- argument for: i deeply like constraints and pass based workflows, where the &quot;when&quot; is of deep importance</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>the actual editing then happens in the anki application.
when edititing, i ask myself the questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;can i reverse this question?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;can i explain this concept from a different lens?&quot;
imporant to remember: redundancy is good
i usually don't allow myself to add cards while reviewing, but when reviewing new cards, it's ok.
also, i make use of llms to generate new question and answer pairs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2024-04-09: brain dump</h2>
<p>having had some months with this workflow, i realized that it's quite important.
however, i should focus on finishing what i start and actually achieving the outcome goals.
only then does a workflow make sense, if you finish something.
and then start again.
once you've finished something.</p>
<p>adopting a right-to-left mindset is super helpful.
i have a bunch of loose thoughts, half-written evergreens that are in desperate need of editing.
i love just dumping all my thoughts.
which is awesome, but editing is important to clarify what you are saying and thinking.
or rather, what you are not ssaying and thinking.
my writing is maximalism.
my editing should be minimalism.</p>
<h2>2024-04-19 first editing iteration</h2>
<p>preamble</p>
<ul>
<li>intended audience: me, someone who wants to garden this document to get better at incremental reading</li>
<li>main points currently:
<ul>
<li>set a learning goal and process</li>
<li>don't dogmatize it, be dynamic</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
